**Empowering academic success through accessible, tech-driven tools.**

## 🌟 Purpose

This dashboard was built to support students—especially working adults, caregivers, and underrepresented learners—who juggle complex schedules and academic deadlines. Inspired by my background in social services and driven by my experience in tech, this tool helps turn confusion into clarity and obstacles into organized action.

> “Digital literacy isn’t just a workplace skill—it’s a catalyst for change.”
