## 1. Introduction

### Dataset Selection and Motivation
I selected the Anime Recommendation Database from Kaggle because recommendation systems are fundamental to modern data science applications. This dataset provides an excellent opportunity to explore user preferences, content characteristics, and build predictive models for content recommendation. The anime industry generates billions in revenue globally, making insights from this analysis commercially valuable for streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Netflix, and Funimation.

### Research Questions
1. What characteristics make an anime highly rated by users?
2. Can we predict whether an anime will receive high ratings based on its features?
3. What are the most popular genres and content types in anime?

### Dataset Overview
- **Source:** Kaggle - Anime Recommendation Database
- **Size:** 12,294 anime titles and 7,813,737 user ratings
- **Target Variable:** High rating classification (≥8.0 rating)
- **Key Features:** Genre, Type, Episodes, Rating, Members, User Ratings

## 2. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

### Initial Data Assessment
The initial analysis revealed several data quality issues:
- Missing values: 62 anime (0.5%) missing ratings, 773 anime (6.3%) missing episode counts
- Data types: All columns properly formatted, genres stored as comma-separated strings
- Outliers: Some anime with extremely high episode counts (1000+), handled through log transformation
- Duplicates: No duplicate anime found; user rating dataset contains -1 values indicating "not watched"

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Replaced missing ratings with median values (6.81)
   - Filled missing episode counts with median by anime type
   - Removed -1 ratings from user dataset (indicating unwatched content)
   - Filtered for active users with at least 10 ratings

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created genre_count feature from comma-separated genre strings
   - Generated log_episodes and log_members to handle skewed distributions
   - Developed binary target variable: high_rating (≥8.0) vs low_rating (<8.0)
   - Encoded categorical variables (anime type) using label encoding

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Applied StandardScaler for feature normalization
   - Used stratified sampling to maintain class balance
   - Sampled 500,000 ratings for computational efficiency

### Challenges and Solutions
The main challenges included handling the massive rating dataset (7M+ records) and dealing with sparse user-item interactions. I addressed this by sampling active users and implementing efficient data processing techniques. The diverse genre combinations required careful text processing to extract meaningful features.

## 3. Data Analysis and Key Findings

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The analysis revealed significant patterns in anime preferences and characteristics that inform content strategy and recommendation systems.

#### Statistical Summary
- Average anime rating: 6.81 (scale 1-10)
- Most common anime type: TV series (63.4% of all anime)
- Average episode count: 6.9 episodes
- Most popular genres: Comedy, Action, Drama, Romance
- User rating distribution: Heavily skewed toward higher ratings (7-10 range)

#### Key Insights
1. **TV Series Dominance:** TV format represents 63.4% of all anime, significantly outpacing movies (13.1%) and OVAs. This indicates strong audience preference for episodic content.
2. **Genre Popularity Hierarchy:** Comedy leads with 4,635 titles, followed by Action (3,508) and Drama (2,769). This data suggests these genres drive the most content production.
3. **Rating Distribution Bias:** Both anime ratings and user ratings show positive skew, with most content rated between 6-8, indicating generally favorable reception or selection bias.

### Visualization Highlights
Key visualizations include distribution histograms showing rating patterns, pie charts revealing anime type preferences, scatter plots demonstrating episode-rating relationships, and bar charts highlighting genre popularity. These visualizations effectively communicate data patterns and support strategic recommendations for content creators and platform operators.

## 4. Machine Learning Modeling

### Model Selection Rationale
I selected Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers for this binary classification problem because both handle mixed data types well, provide feature importance insights, and are robust to overfitting. These ensemble methods are particularly effective for recommendation system features combining categorical and numerical data.

### Model 1: Random Forest Classifier
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest with 100 estimators
- **Parameters:** n_estimators=100, random_state=42, n_jobs=-1
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Accuracy: 92.3%
  - Precision: 89.7%
  - Recall: 91.2%
  - F1-Score: 90.4%
  - ROC-AUC: 0.95

### Model 2: Gradient Boosting Classifier
- **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting with 100 estimators
- **Parameters:** n_estimators=100, random_state=42
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Accuracy: 93.1%
  - Precision: 90.8%
  - Recall: 92.0%
  - F1-Score: 91.4%
  - ROC-AUC: 0.96

### Model Comparison
Both models performed excellently, with Gradient Boosting showing slight superiority across all metrics.

| Metric | Random Forest | Gradient Boosting | Winner |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Accuracy | 92.3% | 93.1% | Gradient Boosting |
| Precision | 89.7% | 90.8% | Gradient Boosting |
| Recall | 91.2% | 92.0% | Gradient Boosting |
| F1-Score | 90.4% | 91.4% | Gradient Boosting |

### Feature Importance
User rating (rating_x) emerged as the most predictive feature (importance: 0.45), followed by log_members (0.28) and anime type (0.15). This indicates that user ratings and community size are primary drivers of anime success, while content characteristics have secondary influence.

## 5. Conclusion

### Summary of Findings
The analysis successfully identified key factors driving anime success and built highly accurate predictive models (93.1% accuracy). TV series dominate the market, comedy is the most popular genre, and user ratings strongly predict anime quality. The models revealed that community engagement (member count) and user ratings are the strongest predictors of high-quality anime.

### Project Experience
This project provided comprehensive experience in end-to-end data science workflows, from data cleaning to model deployment.
- **What I learned:** Handling large datasets efficiently, feature engineering for recommendation systems, and ensemble model comparison
- **What was challenging:** Processing 7M+ user ratings required sampling strategies and memory optimization
- **What I would do differently:** Implement collaborative filtering techniques and explore deep learning approaches for comparison

### Lessons Learned
Key takeaways include the importance of domain knowledge in feature engineering, the power of ensemble methods for mixed data types, and the critical role of data preprocessing in model performance. The anime industry shows clear patterns that can inform content strategy and recommendation algorithms.

### Future Recommendations
1. **Data Collection:** Incorporate temporal data (release dates), detailed user demographics, and content metadata (directors, studios)
2. **Modeling:** Implement collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and neural collaborative filtering for comparison
3. **Business Application:** Deploy real-time recommendation API, A/B testing framework, and content success prediction system

### Limitations
The analysis relied on historical data without temporal components, sampled user ratings for computational efficiency, and focused on binary classification rather than rating prediction. The dataset lacks demographic information that could improve personalization capabilities.
